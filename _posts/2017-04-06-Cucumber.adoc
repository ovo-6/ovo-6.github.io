= Cucumber
:hp-tags: java, testing

Cucumber is tool for capturing requirements for system to be implemented and also for tracking the state of implementation in automated manner.

Basically someone (e.g. product owner) defines requirements in specific areas of functionality in plain english sentences. This is example:

[source,txt]
----
Scenario: Invalid login
  When admin logs in with password invalid
  Then the server should handle it and return a UNAUTHORIZED status
----

Then someone else (e.g. developer) will implement code behind these sentences that will call actual implementation to prove it is really implemented.
